This is my portfolio. I build it to give future employers a glimpse into my background and the projects I have completed.

Some features of this website include buttons with pseduo elements including hover and active click funtionality. The images at the bottom have the same elements including a color changing border and will grow while the cursor hovers over them. 

The style sheet includes a media query so that the nav link background will change colors at a certain pixel. The buttons themselves will also move into a column format at the same pixel count.
